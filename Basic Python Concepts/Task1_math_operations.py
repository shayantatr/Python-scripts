#Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

#1. Takes two numbers as input from the user.


num1 = int(input("Enter First Number :"))
num2 = int(input("Enter Second Number :"))


#2.Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:

Addition = num1 + num2
Subtraction = num1 - num2
Multiplication = num1 * num2
Division = num1 / num2


#3.Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

print("\nResults :")
print(f"Addition : {num1} + {num2} = {Addition}")
print(f"Subtraction :{num1} - {num2} = {Subtraction}")
print(f"Multiplication :{num1} * {num2} = {Multiplication}")
print(f"Division :{num1} / {num2} = {Division}")
