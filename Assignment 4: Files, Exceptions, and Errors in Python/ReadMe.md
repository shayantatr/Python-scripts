# Python Files and Exception Handling - Assignment 4

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
This script (`read_file.py`) reads a file named `sample.txt` line by line and handles the `FileNotFoundError` if the file doesn't exist.

## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
This script (`write_append_file.py`) takes input from the user, writes it to `output.txt`, appends more input, and displays the final file content.
