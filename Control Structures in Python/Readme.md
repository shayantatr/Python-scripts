# Assignment 2 - Module 3: Control Structures in Python

This repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate control structures such as `if-else` statements and `for` loops.

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

- File: `even_or_odd.py`
- Takes user input and checks if the number is even or odd.
- Uses `if-else` condition to determine the result.

## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50

- File: `sum_1_to_50.py`
- Uses a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 50.
- Calculates and prints the sum of all numbers in the range.

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed.

```bash
python even_or_odd.py
python sum_1_to_50.py
